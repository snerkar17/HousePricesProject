# HousePricesProject

• Developed a website using Zillow time series housing data to analyze real estate trends by city.

• Implemented a robust data pipeline in Java to efficiently process and store time series data into a MySQL database from a CSV file.

• Created interactive APIs using Node.js and React, enabling users to select a state and city of interest, and generating visualized line graphs representing house prices from 2000 to 2023 using 'recharts'

• Leveraged a tech stack that includes React, Node.js, Java, MySQL, SQL, and Javascript to ensure seamless data flow, user-friendly interface, and smooth data visualization.
